## 📝 Brief (Round 1)

The objective for this application was:
> Create a data visualization page. It must load Chart.js from a CDN and render a vertical bar chart inside an HTML `<canvas>` element with the id `#user-chart`. Use the `month` property from the attached `chart-data.json` for the labels (X-axis) and the `signups` property for the data (Y-axis). The chart should have a title that says 'Monthly User Signups'.

## 🚀 Deployment

The live application is deployed using GitHub Pages.
